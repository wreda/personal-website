# Biography

I'm currently a PhD student who is pursuing a joint degree at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and the Catholic University of Louvain (UCL). I am supervised by [Marco Canini](https://mcanini.github.io) and [Dejan KostiÄ‡](http://people.kth.se/~dejanko/index.html). On a high-level, my interests are mainly in distributed systems and networks. I have recently been working on improving performance predictability in distributed data-stores through intelligent scheduling of user requests at the backends.
